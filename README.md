# -DE--COMPRESS
The file compression and sharing project aims to provide users with a convenient and efficient solution for managing their files. The project allows users to create files, compress them to reduce their size, decompress previously compressed files, and easily share files with others via email (Gmail) or instant messaging (WhatsApp). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) File compression is an essential technique used to reduce the size of files, enabling efficient storage and transmission of data. One popular approach for achieving compression is Huffman coding, a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to different characters based on their frequency of occurrence within the file.---------------------------------------------------
2) The project offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform these operations with ease. It provides a clear and intuitive workflow, enabling users to create, compress, decompress, and share files effortlessly. By combining file management, compression, and sharing capabilities, this project aims to enhance productivity and simplify file-related tasks for users. -----------------------------
3) Overall, the file compression and sharing project offers a comprehensive solution for efficient file management. By incorporating compression techniques and seamless sharing functionality, it provides users with an optimized approach to handle their files, ultimately improving storage efficiency and facilitating smooth collaboration.
